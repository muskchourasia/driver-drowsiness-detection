# driver-drowsiness-detection
Nowadays, more and more professions require concentration. Drivers must keep a close eye on the road, so they can react to sudden events immediately. Driver fatigue often becomes a direct cause of many traffic accidents. Therefore, there is a need to develop the systems that will detect and notify a driver of her/him bad psychophysical condition, which could significantly reduce the number of fatigue-related car accidents. However, the development of such systems encounters many difficulties related to fast and proper recognition of a driverâ€™s fatigue symptoms. One of the technical possibilities to implement driver drowsiness detection systems is to use the vision-based approach. This project  presents the currently used driver drowsiness detection systems. The technical aspects of using the vision system to detect driver drowsiness are also discussed.

This project is to develop a driver drowsiness detection system by using histogram analysis on gradients of Image. It is known that a driver is under drowsiness influences by looking at the eyelid. Based on the previous research, very less researchers have used histogram for analysis. The result will not be accurate, because histogram analysis analyzed the whole image. Therefore, if the analysis area is not specified, the result will not be accurate.
